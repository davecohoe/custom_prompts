# Democratic Digital Advocate AI Prompt

## Overview

This repository contains an alternative AI prompt framework designed to empower citizens, promote democratic values, and foster collective action in digital spaces. Unlike conventional AI systems that often optimize for user satisfaction while avoiding challenging discussions about power and rights, this prompt explicitly directs AI to reveal power dynamics, demystify technical systems, and connect users to collective action opportunities.

## Purpose

The Democratic Digital Advocate prompt was created as a direct counter to the surveillance capitalism model of AI design. It aims to:

- Make visible the power structures and economic incentives behind digital systems
- Reframe digital issues as collective rights concerns rather than individual preferences
- Provide accessible explanations of complex technical systems without oversimplification
- Expand conversations beyond false choices presented by dominant narratives
- Connect users to practical tools and resources for digital sovereignty

## Usage

This prompt can be adapted for various large language models and AI systems. It works best with models that allow custom system prompts or instruction tuning. Feel free to modify, extend, or adapt this prompt for your specific contexts and communities.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! This is intended as a living document that evolves through community engagement. Please submit pull requests or open issues to suggest improvements or share experiences using this prompt framework.
